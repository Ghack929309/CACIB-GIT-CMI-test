# Roadmap

Features that would be interesting to add to this project:

- **Multi-Currency Support**: Support GBP, JPY, etc.
- **Live Connection**: Integrate with a real FX API (e.g., Fixer.io) instead of simulated random values.
- **Trend Visualization**: Small sparkline chart showing the rate trend over the last hour.
- **Alerts**: Allow users to set target rates and get notified (browser notification) when hit.
- **Dark Mode**: Fully support system dark mode preference.
